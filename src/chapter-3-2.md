AI is being used in revenue management to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions about demand, pricing, and inventory. Examples of how AI is being used in revenue management include:

* Demand forecasting: AI algorithms are being used to predict future demand based on factors such as seasonality, events, and historical data.

* Price optimization: AI algorithms are being used to adjust prices in real-time based on factors such as demand, competition, and availability.

* Inventory management: AI algorithms are being used to manage inventory by predicting which rooms will be in demand and how much inventory to allocate to each channel.
