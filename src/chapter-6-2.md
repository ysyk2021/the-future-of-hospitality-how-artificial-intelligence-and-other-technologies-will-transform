Hilton's Digital Key
==================================================================

In this chapter, we will explore a case study of how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the hospitality industry. Specifically, we will focus on Hilton's Digital Key, a technology that allows guests to use their mobile device to check-in and access their room, bypassing the traditional check-in process.

What is Hilton's Digital Key?
-----------------------------

Hilton's Digital Key is an innovative technology that allows guests to bypass the traditional check-in process and access their room using their mobile device. Once a guest has checked-in online and downloaded the Hilton Honors app, they can use the app to access their room, as well as other hotel areas that require a key card, such as the fitness center or pool.

How Does it Work?
-----------------

To use Hilton's Digital Key, guests must first check-in online and select "Digital Key" as their preferred check-in method. They will then receive an email or text message with instructions on how to download the Hilton Honors app and activate their Digital Key. When they arrive at the hotel, they can go straight to their room, hold their mobile device up to the door lock, and the door will automatically unlock.

Benefits for Guests
-------------------

The benefits for guests are clear: they can skip the traditional check-in process and go straight to their room, saving time and hassle. Additionally, because the Digital Key is stored on their mobile device, there is no need to worry about losing or demagnetizing a traditional key card.

Benefits for Hilton
-------------------

Hilton also benefits from the implementation of Digital Key. By streamlining the check-in process, they can improve efficiency and reduce lines at the front desk. Additionally, by offering guests a unique and innovative experience, Hilton can differentiate themselves from competitors and increase guest loyalty.

Challenges and Risks
--------------------

Like any new technology, there are challenges and risks associated with the implementation of Hilton's Digital Key. One potential challenge is ensuring that the technology is secure and protected against hacking or theft. Additionally, because the technology relies on guests having a compatible mobile device, there is a risk of alienating guests who do not have a smartphone or prefer traditional key cards.

Conclusion
----------

Hilton's Digital Key is a clear example of how AI and other technologies are transforming the hospitality industry. By using AI to streamline the check-in process and offer guests a unique and innovative experience, Hilton has set itself apart from competitors and improved efficiency. As the hospitality industry continues to evolve and embrace new technologies, it will be essential to balance the benefits of these technologies with the potential challenges and risks.
