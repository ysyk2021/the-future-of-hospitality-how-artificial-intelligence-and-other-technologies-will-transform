In recent years, the hospitality industry has increasingly turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency, enhance guest experiences, and reduce costs. One area where AI is making a significant impact is in robotics and automated services. In this chapter, we will explore the foundations of AI in hospitality, specifically focusing on robotics and automated services.

What are Robotics and Automated Services?
-----------------------------------------

Robotics refers to the use of robots in the hospitality industry to perform tasks such as cleaning rooms, delivering items to guests, and providing information and assistance. Automated services, on the other hand, refer to the use of technology to automate tasks such as check-in, ordering food or drinks, and making reservations.

How are Robotics and Automated Services Being Used in Hospitality?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples of robotics and automated services being used in hospitality include:

* Robot butlers: Some hotels are using robots to deliver items to guests, such as towels or room service orders.

* Cleaning robots: Hotels are also using robots to clean rooms, reducing the need for human housekeepers.

* Chatbots: Many hotels are using chatbots to provide guests with information and assistance, such as local recommendations or help with booking a reservation.

* Self-check-in kiosks: Some hotels are using self-check-in kiosks to reduce lines at the front desk and improve efficiency.

Benefits of Robotics and Automated Services
-------------------------------------------

The benefits of robotics and automated services in hospitality are clear. By using robots to perform tasks such as cleaning and delivery, hotels can improve efficiency, reduce labor costs, and free up staff to focus on other tasks. Additionally, by using chatbots and self-check-in kiosks, hotels can improve the guest experience, providing quick and easy access to information and reducing wait times.

Challenges and Risks
--------------------

Despite the benefits, there are also challenges and risks associated with the use of robotics and automated services in hospitality. One potential challenge is ensuring that the technology is reliable and that robots do not malfunction or cause damage to property or guests. Additionally, there is a risk of alienating guests who prefer human interaction and may perceive the use of robots as impersonal.

Conclusion
----------

Robotics and automated services are just one aspect of how AI is transforming the hospitality industry. By using robots to perform tasks such as cleaning and delivery, and technology to automate tasks such as check-in and ordering, hotels can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the guest experience. As the hospitality industry continues to embrace AI, it will be essential to balance the benefits of these technologies with the potential challenges and risks.
